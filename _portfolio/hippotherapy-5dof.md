Developed the dynamic model of a 5-DOF hippotherapy rehabilitation platform for pelvic rotations and translational motions. Formulated equations of motion using Lagrangian and Jacobian-based representations; built simulation to evaluate pelvic trajectories, stability envelopes, and rider balance under perturbations. Ongoing since 09/2025.
