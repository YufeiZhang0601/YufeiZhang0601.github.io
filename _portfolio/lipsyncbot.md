Developed a multi-DOF robotic lip mechanism with AL20C servos and custom silicone mouth. Designed phoneme-to-viseme mapping for 44 English phonemes and a servo-angle calibration GUI for 12 lip shapes. Implemented Python-based lip-sync pipeline combining TTS phoneme timing with servo trajectory interpolation. Ongoing since 02/2025.
