The ionosphere significantly impacts radio wave propagation and GNSS. This work focuses on TEC prediction using deep learning models: Transformer, CNN-BiLSTM-Attention, and PatchTST. PatchTST introduces a segmentation strategy to decompose TEC sequences into localized patches, enabling efficient learning of multi-scale ionospheric variations through self-attention mechanisms. PatchTST outperforms the other models in the comparative study.
