Proposed an improved DQN-based Transfer Reinforcement Learning method (Transfer-DQN) for robust gas turbine rotor fault diagnosis. Applied multi-scale one-dimensional wide convolutional neural network (M-WDCNN) with ε-greedy strategy for Q-network fitting; achieved 98.95% and 96.91% accuracy on CWRU and domestic gas turbine test bench. Sole author; accepted at IEEE SMC 2023 (CCF-C).
