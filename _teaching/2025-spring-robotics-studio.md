**Teaching Assistant** (Advisor: Prof. Hod Lipson), 02/2025–06/2025

Guided student teams in designing quadruped and other bio-inspired robots. Provided technical support in CAD modeling, mechanical design, robot simulation, and reinforcement learning for legged systems. Assisted with PyBullet setup, PPO-based RL, reward tuning, and sim-to-real transfer. Developed instructional examples from own quadruped locomotion framework (peak simulated running speed 25.33 m/s). Weekly debugging, design advice, and grading for 80+ students.
